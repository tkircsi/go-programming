Go programmers often describe a map used in this fashion as a “set of strings” without further ado, but beware, not all map[string]bool values are simple sets; some may contain both true and false values. Sometimes we need a map or set whose keys are slices, but because a map’s keys must be comparable, this cannot be expressed directly. However, it can be done in two steps. First we define a helper function k that maps each key to a string, with the property that k(x) == k(y) if and only if we consider x and y equivalent. Then we create a map whose keys are strings, applying the helper function to each key before we access the map.
