Light 'em up, light 'em up
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
Summer nights, bright lights
And the shootin' stars, they break my heart
Callin' you now, but you're not pickin' up

Summer nights, bright lights
Shadows so close if that's still enough
Light a match, light a match
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
Summer nights, bright lights
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
No, love
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away
So far away

God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away
It's breakin' me, losin' you
We were far from perfect
But we were worth it
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away
Too many fights, and we cried
But never said we're sorry
Stop sayin' you love me
